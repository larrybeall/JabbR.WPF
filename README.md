This is a WPF JabbR client styled to using Metro methodologies.  This is a very rough client and currently only has very limited message sending and receiving capabilities. You can not currently send messages.  I'm putting this up to get feedback and allow anyone interested in helping to do so.  I am currently in a refactor/rearchitecture effort with some of core functionality.
